# CaptaionSpaceProject
This program elaborate the images and define the basic data that we need to calculate the indices of the project.

Three conversion tables have been defined: 

-	fastiecm_IS.py
-	fastiecm _IFH.py
-	fastiecm _IF.py

We used these tables to colorize the images according to the NDVI ranges used in the indexes:

After image processing, the software defines the number of pixels of each specific color and creates a CSV file with data that can be easily processed in Excel.
